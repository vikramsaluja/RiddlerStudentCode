| Aug 27 |  4:40 - 5:55pm  | I started by thinking about how code the decryption of the second riddle by using the number's ascii values. From there I was able to decrypt the riddle except for the last number since there was no space following that number. Then I thought about how I fix that issue and decided to check for the ascii value of the last number after my main loop had ended.  |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
