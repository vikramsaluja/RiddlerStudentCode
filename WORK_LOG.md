| Aug 22 | 11:40am-12:10pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I worked with my table group to solve the first 3 levels of puzzles |
| Aug 26 |  7:50 - 8:25pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I was thinking about how to put the first decyption into actual code since I know that each letter must be shifted by 9 |
| Aug 27 |  4:40 - 5:55pm  | I started by thinking about how code the decryption of the second riddle by using the number's ascii values. From there I was able to decrypt the riddle except for the last number since there was no space following that number. Then I thought about how I fix that issue and decided to check for the ascii value of the last number after my main loop had ended. |
| Aug 31 |  8:00 - 8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I improved my code for solving the ceaser cipher by making it case sensative, rather than the entire decryption being lowercase |
| Sept 1 |  7:15 - 7:35pm  |                                                                                                                                I competed the 3rd encyption level with the binary shift. I sectioned off every 8 digits in order to get each binary number. One thing that I learnt was giving parseInt another paramenter indicate that it is reciving a binary number |
| Sept 1 |   7:45 - 9pm    |                                                                                 I completed the last encyption level and was able to figure out that the shift was 9019. I then used a similar alogirthm to the previous decrptyions in order to solve the puzzle. I also ensured to add in an if statement to check and make sure that the numbers would wrap around.  |
